# Swan Grants

## Purpose

Welcome to the Swan Grant Platform! The Swan Grant Platform connects grant makers with builders and researchers
in the Swan community.

The Grants Council serves by delegation from Token House. The Grants Council exists to:

* create a more streamlined and consistent process for proposers
* set a pace for grant distributions
* define a clear scope, with clear differentiation from Partner Fund
* create accountability via smaller grant sizes and milestone-based distributions

## Open Grant

Do you have an idea for pushing the Swan ecosystem forward? Grants of $5,000 in Swan are available to support those
taking the next step after creating an initial prototype with Swan technologies.

## Requests for Proposals (RFPs)

RFPs are grants for specific development work. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to
complete the work specified in each RFP. In these grants, we generally have clearly scoped deliverables, milestones, and
funding limits. Some RFPs will ask you to propose your own milestones and funding needs. While there is some flexibility
in RFP deliverables, we expect teams will deliver what is in scope in the RFP. Any deviations from the specified scope
must be approved between your team and ours before we can approve funding.
