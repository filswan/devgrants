# Request for Proposals (RFP): UBI-ZK Proof Development

## Overview

We are excited to announce a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the development of a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof system,
named UBI-ZK. This system, rooted in a random seed, aims to bolster the transparency, security, and efficiency of our
platform.

## Project Description

### Objective:

Develop a ZK proof system that:

- Derives from a random seed.
- Produces valid and verifiable proofs.
- Categorizes into two types of ZK proofs: CPU and GPU.
- Is tailored for Nvidia GPUs with specific hardware prerequisites.
- Posts its results on the EVM blockchain for straightforward validation.

### Detailed Requirements:

1. **ZK Proof Generation**:
    - The system should be capable of generating ZK proofs based on a random seed.
    - The generated proofs must be valid and verifiable.

2. **Hardware Optimization**:
    - The ZK algorithm should be fine-tuned for Nvidia GPUs.
    - Minimum hardware requirements:
        - GPU: Nvidia with a minimum of 8GB memory.
        - Storage: At least 100GB of free space.

3. **Categories**:
    - The system should support two distinct categories of ZK proofs:
        1. CPU-based proofs.
        2. GPU-based proofs.

4. **Blockchain Integration**:
    - The ZK proof results should be posted on the EVM blockchain.
    - These results should be easily validated by other network participants.

## Proposal Submission Guidelines on GitHub:

- Create a **new issue** titled "UBI-ZK Proof Development Proposal".
- In the issue, include the following sections:
    - **Project Plan**: Detail your approach, methodology, and timeline.
    - **Team Qualifications**: Share your team's expertise in ZK proofs, GPU optimizations, and blockchain integrations.
    - **Budget**: Provide a breakdown of the anticipated costs.
    - **Milestones**: Define clear project milestones with expected deliverables and timelines.
    - **References**: List relevant past projects or experiences.
- **Label** your issue with "RFP" and "UBI-ZK".
- Submit the issue and share the link in the designated submission portal or email.

## Evaluation Criteria:

Proposals will be assessed based on:

- Technical expertise and prior experience.
- The clarity and feasibility of the proposed approach.
- Cost-effectiveness.
- Previous performance on related projects.

## Submission Deadline:

October 30, 2023 at 23:59:59 EST
